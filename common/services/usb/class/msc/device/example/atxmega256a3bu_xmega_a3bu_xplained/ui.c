 * Human interface on XMEGA-A3BU Xplained:
 * - Led 0 is on when USB line is in IDLE mode, and off in SUSPEND mode
 * - Led 1 blinks when USB host has checked and enabled MSC interface
 * - Green LED close to USB connector is on when reading from the USB mass Storage interface
 * - Red LED close to USB connector is on when writing from the USB mass Storage interface
